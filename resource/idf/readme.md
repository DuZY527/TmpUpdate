建筑输入数据文件

The `input data file` (IDF) is an ASCII file containing the data describing the building and HVAC
system to be simulated. Many example files are installed as part of the EnergyPlus installation.
Additionally, a spreadsheet file “ExampleFiles.xls” contains columnar descriptions of each file’s
features.
